# cifar-vgg
VGG16 models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using Keras.
This package contains 2 classes one for each datasets, the architecture is based on the VGG-16 [1] with adaptation to CIFAR datasets based on [2].
The CIFAR-10 reaches a validation accuracy of 93.56%
CIFAR-100 reaches validation accuracy of 70.48%.
On instantiation the model can either be trained or loaded from previous save weight file.
